## Problem Statement  
A food distribution system is designed to ensure that food is safely and efficiently distributed to those who need it. Common challenges include food waste, food safety, and transportation logistics. The goal is to provide access to nutritious and affordable food for all members of a community.  

## Proposed Solution   
The FOOD FOR ALL Application's goal is to provide a single platform for food suppliers to connect with customers. Forming a bridge between customers and service providers such that customers do not need to open many windows to complete tasks; instead, a single application is sufficient to buy food. The application can be maintained by the organization's administrator, while the customer can operate on any domain, based on their needs.
